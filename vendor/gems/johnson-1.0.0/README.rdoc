= Johnson

Johnson wraps JavaScript in a loving Ruby embrace.

* {Source Code}[http://github.com/jbarnette/johnson]
* {Bug Tracker}[http://johnson.lighthouseapp.com]
* {RubyForge Project}[http://johnson.rubyforge.org]

== Usage

  # FIXME: write some decent examples
  require "johnson"
  
  Johnson.evaluate("4 + 4") # => 8
  Johnson.evaluate("4 + foo", :foo => 4) # => 8
  
== Installing

We haven't rolled an official 1.0 for Johnson, though we plan to Real Soon Now.
For the moment, follow the instructions in "Installing Development Versions".
Once we push a 1.0 to RubyForge, it'll be as easy as:

  [sudo] gem install johnson

== Installing Development Versions

We periodically update Johnson's gemspec on Github. Rather than installing the
official releases (hosted on RubyForge), you can track the development version.
Development versions will have a timestamped version number, like 1.0.0.200806232349.

  # requires RubyGems 1.2!
  [sudo] gem sources -a http://gems.github.com
  [sudo] gem install jbarnette-johnson
