PermanentRecords
================

This plugin prevents any of your records from being destroyed casually.
Any model with a deleted_at datetime column will have that column set rather than being deleted.

Usage
=======

User.find(3).destroy          # sets the 'deleted_at' attribute to Time.now and returns a frozen record
User.find(3).destroy(:force)  # executes the real destroy method, the record will be removed from the database
User.delete_all               # bye bye everything

There are also two named scopes provided for easily searching deleted and not deleted records:

User.send :with_deleted { User.find(:all) }     # only returns deleted records.
User.send :with_not_deleted { User.find(:all) } # you guessed it.

These are named so as to work smoothly with other scoping plugins like scope_out.
